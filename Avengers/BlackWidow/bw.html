<!a bit of a bio for black widow followed by some images and the trailer for her new movie>
      <p class="maincontent">Black Widow, otherwise known as Natasha Romanoff, is an essential character in the Marvel Cinematic universe. However, her fame in comic book did not grow until the 1970s. She first appeared in April 1964 on Tales of Suspense #52. She later started to reappear in more comics in the 70’s, mostly associated with SHIELD. Black Widow was born in Stalingrad. It has been rumored that she is the last member of the Czars, but it has yet to be proven. At an early age, she was injected with the super-soldier serum and went through harsh training by the Black Widow ops Program of the now non-existent nation of Soviet Russia. The program was the nation’s way against the US in the Cold War but also a program to show the Soviets can create super-soldiers like Captain Rogers. She later joins the KGB where she was dubbed “Black Widow”. Later on, Nick Fury invites her to join SHIELD where she becomes a huge supportive character in the comics inspiring her character to come to life in the MCU.</p>
